# README - Statistics Assignment

## Overview
This assignment covers key concepts in statistics, such as the z-statistic, hypothesis testing, probability distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and more. It also includes practical tasks requiring Python programming for simulation, statistical calculation, and plotting.

### Key Topics:
1. Z-statistics and hypothesis testing
2. P-values and their interpretation
3. Comparison of binomial and Bernoulli distributions
4. Poisson distribution and its application
5. Probability distributions, Probability Density Functions (PDF), and Probability Mass Functions (PMF)
6. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
7. Z-scores vs. t-scores
8. Hypothesis testing using z-scores and p-values
9. Simulating binomial distributions using Python

## Questions and Tasks

### 1. **Z-Statistic and Hypothesis Testing**
   - Define the z-statistic and explain its relationship with the standard normal distribution.
   - Explain how the z-statistic is used in hypothesis testing.

### 2. **P-Value in Hypothesis Testing**
   - Define the p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.
   - Explain what a small p-value (e.g., 0.01) means in terms of rejecting the null hypothesis.

### 3. **Binomial vs. Bernoulli Distributions**
   - Compare and contrast the binomial and Bernoulli distributions.

### 4. **Conditions for Using the Binomial Distribution**
   - Explain when the binomial distribution is used and how it relates to the Bernoulli distribution.

### 5. **Poisson Distribution**
   - List the key properties of the Poisson distribution.
   - Describe when the Poisson distribution is appropriate to use.

### 6. **Probability Distributions and PDFs**
   - Define "probability distribution" and "probability density function" (PDF).
   - Explain the difference between a PDF and a probability mass function (PMF).

### 7. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
   - Explain the Central Limit Theorem with an example.

### 8. **Z-Scores vs. T-Scores**
   - Compare z-scores and t-scores, and describe when each should be used.

### 9. **Z-Score and P-Value Calculation**
   - Given a sample mean, population mean, standard deviation, and sample size, calculate the z-score and p-value.
   - Decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the p-value.

   **Python Task**: Write a Python code to calculate the z-score and p-value for given data.

### 10. **Binomial Distribution Simulation**
   - Simulate a binomial distribution with 10 trials and a probability of success of 0.6 using Python.
   - Generate 1,000 samples and plot the distribution.
   - Calculate the expected mean and variance.
